# Creating a new notebook

**Cloning the master branch/folder**

- Open the Dev Databricks Workspace associated with your project
- Under the Workspace, find the folder that has the name of your project
- When you open it, you can see the branches active under your project
- Clone the master folder and make your branch folder out of it

By cloning the master you will have the most updated version of the code on your branch folder.

**Name it** `feature-<your-branch-name>`.

Then you can start working on the awesome new feature in your separate branch.
